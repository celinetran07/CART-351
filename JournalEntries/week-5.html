                <p>This week, my main focus was finishing the project 1 with my teammate Cathy. We created <a href="../Projects/project01_celine-tran-40296536-cathy-tham-40287326/air_quest_game.py">AirQuest</a>, a terminal-based game that uses real-time air quality data from the World Air Quality Index API. Players travels to different cities and gain or lose health points based on pollution levels. We used Rich, PyFiglet, and Colorama to create visual feedback with ASCII art, color-coded messages, and poetic warnings like "You inhale capitalism" for polluted cities. The project helped me see how gamification can make environmental data feel more immediate and personal than just raw statistics.</p>

                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>I found that working within the constraints of terminal output was surprisingly creative. We couldn't rely on graphics, so every visual choices such as colors, ASCII art or emoji has to work harder to convey meaning. The game mechanics created a strong connection to air quality that numbers alone might not be able to achieve. Collaborating with Cathy also taught me a lot about dividing tasks while maintaining a cohesive vision</p>

                <p>I also read the article <em><a href="https://mlml.io/p/dear-loneliness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Dear Loneliness”</a></em> from the DATA & COLLECTION reading list. The article examines how platforms collect emotional data claiming to address loneliness, yet often create new forms of isolation since we're interfacing with systems rather than people. This made me think about our game's relationship to data. While AirQuest uses real pollution data to create awareness, it's still an abstraction, a simulation rather than the actual experience of breathing toxic air. There's a tension between representing serious environmental issues and turning them into solo entertainment. Both the article and our project highlight this gap between data representation and lived reality, and the often-isolating nature of digital interfaces even when they address collective problems.</p>
