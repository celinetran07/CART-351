                    This week we continued working with Flask, following up on what we started before the reading week. We focused more on understanding how templates connect with routes and how data moves between Python and HTML. I also worked on Exercise 2 with Cathy, although we mostly worked individually, we often compared our code and helped each other whenever something didn't make sense or when we got stuck. 
                    Additionally, during the reading week, I took some time to work on my personal website, changing up the layout and css styles to make it look cooler and more unique to my personality. I leaned towards a more retro aesthetic with pixel art and bright colors to give it a fun, nostalgic vibe.

                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm starting to get more comfortable with Flask. It still feels a bit abstract at times, but understanding how Jinja templates and routes work together made things click a bit more. Comparing code with Cathy really helped me notice mistakes faster, sometimes a small typo or wrong variable name can make the whole thing break.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, I feel like I'm getting better at debugging and understanding the structure of Flask projects. The exercise was a good mix of review and challenge.
