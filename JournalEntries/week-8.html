                    This week in class, we continued diving deeper into Flask, focusing on more advanced features like sessions, POST requests, and using JavaScript with the Fetch API to send and receive data asynchronously. I also learned how Flask handles storing session variables across multiple pages and how data can be preserved temporarily for individual users. This was followed by an introduction to using Fetch and POST to upload images to the server.

                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>
                    I now have a clearer understanding of how client-side and server-side communication works. The examples we went through helped me see how GET and POST requests differ and how JavaScript can interact with Flask without reloading the page. Working with sessions was also interesting because it gave me a new way to think about storing data beyond just variables in Python. Overall, I'm feeling more confident about building web applications with Flask.

                    Cathy and I also met to start planning for Project 2. We decided to base our Flask project on an idea we were already developing for another class, this project will help us launch this idea and bring it to life. It is an interactive web app called <strong>Split Decision</strong>. The concept is to make group decision-making easier and more engaging by turning it into a fun, game-like experience. Users will be able to input their preferences (for example, where to eat), and the app will store that input on the server side in a JSON file. Then, through small voting games and elimination rounds, the app will help the group reach a final decision together.
