                <p>This week we worked with APIs, specifically the weather API and the World Air Quality Index API. 
                
                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>Understanding the basic concept was fine - APIs let you grab data from other sources. The in-class exercise started simple but got confusing pretty quickly, mainly due to the instructions being very compact, I accidently skipped a few steps and had to go back after realizing.</p>
                
                <p>Working with my teammate helped a lot. When one of us got stuck, the other could usually spot the problem, in my case it was realizing that I skipped a couple lines while trying to complete the exercise. We managed to finish it in the end, which felt good.</p>
              
                <p>It's interesting that you can pull real-time air quality data from anywhere in the world just by making a request. Makes you think about how much data is floating around out there, waiting to be used in creative ways.</p>
                
                <p>I'm curious about using this kind of data for art projects instead of just displaying numbers on a screen.</p>
