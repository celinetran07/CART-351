                <p>This week I've been setting up my GitHub repository, Python and creating the main page and this journal page. It's nice to have a dedicated space to document my learning journey in CART 351!</p>
                
                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>Setting up GitHub Pages was easy as I have done it previously. The only slight hiccup I ran into was when I had to clone my repository. I recently bought a new laptop, therefore vscode and all the apps and packages that I previously had installed in my machine was no longer there. Because of my new machine, I also had difficulties setting Python during Monday's class. I had to reinstall various packages like node.js, some vscode extensions and set up the ssh authentication key to be able to clone from github on the new machine. Once those were taken care of, writing the html, css, javascript and setting up everything else was relatively easy.</p>

                <p>- Complete the GitHub setup and submit my repo URL</p>
                <p>- Get comfortable with the workflow of updating this journal weekly</p>
