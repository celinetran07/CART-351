                    This week, I focused almost entirely on completing <strong>Exercise 5</strong>, which turned out to be the most challenging assignment so far in CART 351. The exercise required us to design original data visualizations using MongoDB queries, Flask, and JavaScript, and although the framework was provided, the creative and technical work involved was much more extensive than I expected.

                    One of the biggest challenges was understanding how to translate queries into visualizations, and the client-side JavaScript. Each query produced a different subset of information, so every visualization needed its own logic, layout, and personality. This forced me to think carefully about how to represent patterns visually without copying the examples. I spent a lot of time testing, adjusting positions, changing spacing, fixing overflow issues, and making sure animations didn't interfere with each other.

                    Even though I worked mostly on my own, I collaborated closely with <strong>Cathy</strong> throughout the week. We shared ideas about possible visualization designs and helped each other debug issues—especially related to animations, color mapping, and how to interpret the results of each MongoDB query. Having someone to problem-solve with made the long process feel more manageable, and it was interesting to see how our visual concepts differed and evolved as we tried different iterations.

                    The entire exercise was surprisingly long and difficult, not because of any single part, but because everything—queries, layout, styling, animation—had to work together seamlessly. I ran into unexpected problems like drift animations affecting other queries, overlapping data points, and alignment issues, all of which required experimenting and revising my approach multiple times. Despite the frustration, it was satisfying to see the final visualizations come together and reflect the patterns hidden in the dataset.

                    Overall, this week pushed me to combine technical logic with creative design in a much deeper way. Exercise 5 was demanding, but it helped me strengthen my understanding of real-time visual rendering, data-driven design decisions, and the importance of organizing code so that every part stays isolated and maintainable.
