                    This week we learned how to use <strong>Flask-SocketIO</strong> to build real-time, interactive web applications. WebSockets allow continuous two-way communication between the client and the server without needing to constantly refresh or send repeated requests. We created an example chat application that used SocketIO to connect multiple users at once, where each client could send messages instantly broadcasted to everyone else. Later, we expanded on this idea by connecting it with a <strong>p5.js</strong> sketch to create a collaborative visualization using flowers that reacts to multiple users interacting at the same time.

                    I found this week's topic very engaging because it added a new layer of interactivity to everything we've built so far. Seeing how real-time data could be shared across multiple users reminded me of multiplayer games or collaborative art tools, where actions update live for everyone.

                    Outside of class, I discovered that some of my links were broken on my GitHub Pages site. Everything had worked perfectly on my local machine, so I hadn't thought to double-check the deployed version. After inspecting the issue, I realized it was a path case-sensitivity problem, which I quickly fixed. Now, all my project and exercise links are working properly again.

                    I also completed <strong>Exercise 4</strong>, where I reviewed several classmates' projects and wrote down my thoughts and feedback in a reflection document. You can view it here:

                    It was really inspiring to see how other students approached their ideas differently, both in concept and in execution. It gave me a lot of insight into how varied Flask projects can be when creativity meets technical design.
