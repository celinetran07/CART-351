                    This week was the first week of the month long STM strike. I was unable to find transportation in due time for class and had to adapt to remote learning. I followed the Flask IV tutorial instructions on my own and completed the exercises independently. I learned how to read from and write to text and JSON files in Python using different file modes and functions like write(), read(), etc. This helped me understand how data can be stored, retrieved, and updated efficiently on the server side. I also practiced sending user information from a p5.js front end to Flask using the Fetch API, which helped me understand how data moves between the client and server.

                    For exercise 3, I collaborated with Cathy and we both created a donut review page, although we mostly worked independently, we collaborate our ideas to achieve similar features. The idea of this page is to build a donut review page where users could pick their favorite donut by clicking on an image, write a short comment, and submit it. When submitted, the data was sent to the Flask backend, saved in a text file, and instantly displayed on the “Community Donut Wall” along with all previous comments. I used JavaScript to dynamically update the page without reloading, which made the interaction feel smooth and playful.

                    Even though I wasn't physically in class, this week felt productive because I could take my time to understand each part of the Flask workflow. I learned how to connect the JavaScript Fetch POST method to a Flask route that saves user input to a text file. A for the exercise, it was fun to create an interactive page that felt more dynamic than just static HTML. However, I spent much more time working on this exercise than I anticipated. I did find it challenging to debug some parts without immediate help from the instructor or classmates. I had to rely on class resources more than usual.
