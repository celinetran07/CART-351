                <p>This week, we started learning about Flask and built a very simple web app using it. Flask is a lightweight Python framework that makes it easy to create dynamic websites, and I actually found the whole exercise surprisingly straightforward and fun to follow.</p>

                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>Compared to some of the previous weeks, this workshop felt a lot smoother. I liked how clear the steps were — setting up the environment, creating routes, and rendering templates all made sense. I especially enjoyed seeing how Python code could be connected directly to HTML files using <strong>Jinja templating</strong>. It made me realize how flexible web development can be when you combine programming logic with design.</p>

                <p>I also read the article <em>“The Space Between Us”</em> from Rhizome, which was part of the reading list under “Bots and Chats.” The piece discussed an app that connects two people by a single arrow that always points towards the other person, no matter how far away they are. Like the writer, I also found this idea really poetic as it turns something ordinary like location tracking using technology into a quiet reflection on relationships and seperation. It made me think about how tools like Flask could also be used to build creative and meaningful interactive experiences, not just functional websites.</p>

                <h3>Goals for this week</h3>
                <p>- Continue experimenting with Flask templates<br>
                   - Work on Project 1 with Cathy, due on October 8th
